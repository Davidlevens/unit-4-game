CrystalsCollector Game 

Instructions:

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
There are four crystals below.

By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific 
amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number.

You lost the game if your total score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

This project involves generating 5 random numbers, 4 numbers between 1 and 12 and 1 number between 19 and 120. 

The JavaScript generates the numbers with Math.random and Math.floor.

Functions are used to show winner and loser alerts.

jQuery is then used to single out button clicks, and then if and else if conditionals keep track of the player totals versus the main random number.

The game then alerts a win or loss and registers a total for each, depending on if the player wins or loses.

I then spent some time tweaking the css styling with text drop shadows, and topped it off with a gem favicon for good measure.

I hope you enjoy the challenge, I certainly did.
